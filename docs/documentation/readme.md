# READMEs

There are two types of "README"s in this project. All of them share the attributes of being named `README.md`, written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, and generally providing an overview of a topic.
 
The canonical `README.md` is located at the top of the repo and generally follows [this readme standard](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md).

There are also several other non-standard readmes found in various directories whose purpose is to provide context for the contents of the directory they are contained within.

## Project README

The project readme generally follows a [standard format](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md). Some other format could be adopted, but it is useful to lean on one.
