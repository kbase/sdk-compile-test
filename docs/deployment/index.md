# Deployment

> TODO: this section should describe how to deploy the sample service and related concerns. E.g. assets within the repo related to deployment, required and optional env vars used in deploy.cfg, the process of preparing a release and deployment, and tools we use for deployment itself. It should also provide links to KBase deployment processes.
